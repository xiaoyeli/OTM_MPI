The main contribution of this work is an open-source implementation of macroscopic traffic simulation for high-performance computing (HPC). As was detailed in the introduction, there are currently a host of platforms for running vehicle-based simulations in HPC. OTM-MPI offers an alternative for scenarios in which macroscopic modeling may be preferred over vehicle-based simulation. This may be the case if the following two conditions are given. First, that the available data is better suited for estimating macroscopic quantities (capacities) than microscopic ones (car-following rules). For example, if the data consists in loop detector measurements, and detailed vehicle accelerations are absent. Second, that the metrics of interest can be obtained from the macroscopic model. For instance, if we are interested in travel times and delays, and not in vehicle accelerations. Studies of routing behaviors in particular, either `natural' or induced by routing apps, can equally be carried out in macroscopic models. OTM-MPI can be obtained from \cite{otmmpi}.
