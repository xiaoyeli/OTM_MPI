The main contribution of this work is an open-source implementation of macroscopic traffic simulation for high-performance computing (HPC). As was detailed in the introduction, there are currently a host of platforms for running vehicle-based simulations in HPC. OTM-MPI offers an alternative for scenarios in which macroscopic modeling may be preferred over vehicle-based simulation. This may be the case if the following two conditions are given. First, that the available data is better suited for estimating macroscopic quantities (capacities) than microscopic ones (car-following rules). For example, if the data consists in loop detector measurements, and detailed vehicle accelerations are absent. Second, that the metrics of interest can be obtained from the macroscopic model. For instance, if we are interested in travel times and delays, and not in vehicle accelerations. Studies of routing behaviors in particular, either `natural' or induced by routing apps, can equally be carried out in macroscopic models. 

The results obtained in this study show significant reductions in execution times. 
For a smaller network, our parallel algorithm achieved a speedup of 198x using 256 cores. For a larger network using 1024 cores, a 375x speedup in computation time was achieved. These are unprecedented speeds for macroscopic traffic simulations.
